# whatsapp-group-chat-analysis

In this fun project, I decided to try my hands on text data for the 1st time. I analysed the text data from a whatsapp group of my friends! I performed some basic cleaning and then analysis. Whatsapp has an option export the chat into .txt file! I used that to extract the group chat messages! 

Go throught the interactive notebook [here](https://jithendrabsy.me/data-sabbath/analysis/jupyter/2020/09/19/whatsapp-group-chat-analysis.html) rather than the github notebook!

Some of the analsis plots are:-

And many more!
